      <h2>About SkyCast</h2>
      <p>
        At SkyCast, our mission is simple: to make weather data clear, accessible, and useful for everyone.
        From casual users wanting to know if they need an umbrella, to professionals relying on hourly
        forecasts, we aim to provide information that helps people plan their day with confidence.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        SkyCast began as a student project, designed to combine the power of modern web technologies with
        real-world data from the OpenWeatherMap API. What started as a small experiment quickly grew into a
        polished platform with live weather updates, a 5-day forecast, an hourly forecast, and an interactive
        weather map.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, we placed a strong emphasis on accessibility, ensuring that our service is inclusive
        for visually impaired users through features like high-contrast mode and screen-reader support.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Technology</h3>
      <p>
        SkyCast is built using clean and modern web standards: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Live weather data
        is powered by OpenWeatherMap, while interactive mapping is delivered through Leaflet.js and
        OpenStreetMap. The design features responsive layouts, an autumn-inspired theme, and card-based
        components that adapt across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
      <p>
        We believe in building tools that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. SkyCast is
        continuously improved, with future enhancements planned such as saving favorite cities, adding
        multi-language support, and generating trend charts for temperature, wind, and humidity.
