# Weather Dashboard

This repository contains my Unit 2 project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

## Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a front-end web application that allows users to search for a city and view the current weather conditions. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with weather data retrieved from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- Search for a city
- Display current temperature and weather conditions
- Responsive layout

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or run with Live Server in VS Code.
3. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in `js/script.js` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Deployment

(Will update when deployed to GitHub Pages)
